Password Management System

Password Generation: Users can generate random passwords of customizable length with or without special characters.
Password Storage: Generated passwords can be saved with titles for easy retrieval later.
Password Retrieval: Users can retrieve passwords by providing the associated title.
Password Update: Users can update existing passwords.
